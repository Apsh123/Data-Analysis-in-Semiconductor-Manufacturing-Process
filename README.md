# Data-Analysis-in-Semiconductor-Manufacturing-Process
Evaluated SECOM (Semiconductor manufacturing process) based on signals/variables collected from sensors and analyzed their efficiency against various quality metrics
Applied KNN-imputation and SMOKE test for data preprocessing
Applied Primary Component Analysis to reduce dimensions of quality metrics
Modeled Logistic regression model, LDA, QDA, KNN, CART, Random Forest, SVM.
Implemented validation set approach to verify the model performance and check for 
overfitting/under fitting
Identified feature significance and came up with actionable insights for improvement
